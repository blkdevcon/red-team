### 7. pyloris
> Using HTTPLoris is simple. In its most basic form, HTTPLoris merely needs a copy of Python 2.6.
#### Usage
On a Linux machine, one must simply invoke the script in a terminal, stating a site to test:
```shell
motoma@rocksalt:/home/motoma$ python pyloris-3.0.py motomastyle.com
```
On Mac OS X, one invokes PyLoris the same way. Using the Terminal Application:
```shell
hotdog:/Users/Motoma/ motoma$ python pyloris-3.0.py motomastyle.com
```
Using HTTPLoris in Windows is a little different. One will need to know the location of the Python installation, and be in the proper directory. Load up a command prompt:
```shell
C:\Users\Motoma\Desktop\pyloris-3.0>C:\Python26\python.exe pyloris-3.0.py motomastyle.com
```
#### Advanced Options
>Invoking HTTPLoris by using the commands above start a limited to 500 connections across 50 threads, each sending at 1 byte/second and waiting until the connection is forced shut by the server. While this behavior will bog down an Apache server with the default settings, it is not a very thorough test. The following are some additionall options that will allow one to customize the way HTTPLoris works:
```
-a, --attacklimit
The --attacklimit flag restricts the number of total connections (current + completed) during a single session. Set this to zero to specify no limit.

-c, --connectionlimit
Adjusting the --connectionlimit flag can drastically change how well HTTPLoris performs. The --connectionlimit flag directly controls the number of concurrent connections held during the session. In a base Apache environment, when this number is above the MaxClients setting, the server is unresponsive.

-t, --threadlimit
This is the number of attacker threads run during the session.

-b, --connectionspeed
This is the connection speed for each individual connection in bytes/second. Comparing this with the lenght of the request, and you should have an accurate guess of how long each connection should linger.

-f, --finish
Specifying the --finish flag will cause HTTPLoris to finish and close connections upon the completion of the request. This will prompt servers to send full responses to the HTTP requests that are made.

-k --keepalive
Using the --keepalive flag will add the Connection: Keep-Alive header to the HTTP request. On vulnerable servers, this will increase the duration of connections considerably.

-p, --port
HTTPLoris will connect on port 80 by default. Specifying the --port flag will change this behavior.

-P, --page
By default, HTTPLoris will make HTTP requests for "/". Setting the --page flag will allow one to control the page that HTTPLoris requests.

-q, --quit
Terminate the connection without receiving reply from the server. This will reduce the effectivenes as connections will terminate as soon as the full request buffer has been sent.

-r, --requesttype
Setting the --requesttype flag will change the HTTP method used. Available options are GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, and TRACE. Certain proxies and load balancers will filter out certain types of requests, and hold them until the requests are complete. POST requests are commonly passed through due to their potential for large sizes, therefore this may cause different behavior.

-R, --referer
Adds a referring URL to the HTTP request.

-s, --Size
The --size flag allows one to increase the size of the request made. Increasing the size will in turn increase the duration of connections, leading to a longer sustained test. In situations where servers or firewalls are set to terminate unfinished connections, this can extend the length of the test drastically. This can also be used to test a web server's capability to handle multiple large requests and benchmark memory usage. The additional data is filled in the Cookie-Data field.

-u, --useragent
By default, HTTPLoris advertizes itself in the User-Agent header. The --useragent flag allows one to override this and masquerade as other web browsers. Useful because some sites will render different pages for different web browsers. 

-z, --gzip
Specifying the --gzip flag will allow instruct PyLoris to send an "Accept-Encoding: gzip" header. When combined with the --quit and --finish flags, this can test for the CEV-2009-1891 DoS vulnerability (http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@httpd.apache.org/msg44323.html). Also leads to larger CPU usage and smaller bandwidth usage.

-w, --timebetweenthreads
Setting the --timebetweenthreads flag will adjust the amount of time between threads spawning. Adjusting this in conjunction with the --threadlimit will change the CPU load on your local machine.

-W, --timebetweenconnections
Setting the --timebetweenconnections flag will adjust the amount of time between socket connections. This will directly affect how quickly the target's connection limit is reached.

Proxy Options 
HTTPLoris is able to connect through SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxies. This allows HTTPLoris to run through SSH tunnels, as well as TOR. Utilizing TOR should essentially eliminate the mitigating effects of ipchains, mod_antiloris, and mod_noloris.

--socksversion
Setting the --socksversion flag tells HTTPLoris to connect through a SOCKS proxy. Allowed values are SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP.

--sockshost
Set the --sockshost flag to the address of the SOCKS proxy when --socksversion is set. If this is not set, HTTPLoris will default to 127.0.0.1.

--socksport
Set the --socksport flag to the port number of the SOCKS proxy when --socksversion is set. 

--socksuser and --sockspass
Optionally, one may set a username and password for the SOCKS proxy using these two flags.
```

### 8. Rudy (R U Dead yet)
> ‘R U Dead Yet?’ or R.U.D.Y. is a denial-of-service attack tool that aims to keep a web server tied up by submitting form data at an absurdly slow pace. A R.U.D.Y. exploit is categorized as a low-and-slow attack, since it focuses on creating a few drawn-out requests rather than overwhelming a server with a high volume of quick requests. A successful R.U.D.Y. attack will result in the victim’s origin server becoming unavailable to legitimate traffic.  

>The R.U.D.Y. software includes a user-friendly point-and-click interface, so all an attacker needs to do is point the tool at a vulnerable target. Any web service that accepts form input is vulnerable to a R.U.D.Y. attack, since the tool works by sniffing out form fields and exploiting the form submission process.

### 9. Torshammer
```
USAGE:

./torshammer.py -t <target> [-r <threads> -p <port> -T -h]
-t|--target <Hostname|IP>
-r|--threads <Number of threads> Defaults to 256
-p|--port <Web Server Port> Defaults to 80
-T|--tor Enable anonymising through tor on 127.0.0.1:9050
-h|--help Shows this help

Eg. ./torshammer.py -t 192.168.1.100 -r 256
```

### 10. hping
```
DESCRIPTION

	hping3 is a network tool able to send custom TCP/IP
	packets and to display target replies like ping do with
	ICMP replies. hping3 can handle fragmentation, and
	almost arbitrary packet size and content, using the
	command line interface.

	Since version 3, hping implements scripting capabilties,
	read the API.txt file under the /docs directory to know
	more about it.

	As a command line utility, hping is useful to test at
	many kind of networking devices like firewalls, routers,
	and so. It can be used as a traceroute alike program over all
	the supported protocols, firewalk usage, OS fingerprinting,
	port-scanner (see the --scan option introduced with hping3),
	TCP/IP stack auditing.

	It's also really a good didactic tool to learn TCP/IP.

	Using Tcl/Tk scripting much more can be done, because
	while the hping3 packet generation code is actually the
	hping2 put there mainly for compatibility with the command
	line interface, all the real news are about scripting.

	See the libs directory for example scripts. To run
	the example scripts type:

		hping3 exec ScriptName.htcl <arguments, if required>

	hping3 is developed and manteined by antirez@invece.org
	with the help of other hackers, and comes under GPL version
	2 of license. Development is open so you can send me
	patches/suggestions/affronts without inhibitions.

	Please check the AUTHORS file for a list of people that
	contribued with code, ideas, bug reports.

	Also vim developer, ee.lbl.gov for tcpdump and GNU in general.

DOCUMENTATION

	For the hping3 API check docs/API.txt

	You can find documentation about hping3 specific functions
	at http://wiki.hping.org

	Make sure to check the page at http://wiki.hping.org/34

REQUIREMENTS

	A supported unix-like OS, gcc, root access.

	Libpcap.

	Tcl/Tk is optional but strongly suggested.

INSTALLATION

	see INSTALL file.

have fun,
