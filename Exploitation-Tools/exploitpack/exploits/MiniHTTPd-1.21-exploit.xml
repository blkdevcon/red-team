# The instability of the existing is down to bad chars, and the parent thread
# killing off the child thread when the thing is still running. This exploit
# allocates memory in a safe area, copies the payload to it, creates a new
# thread which runs the payload and then suspends the current thread. The
# suspending of the thread forces the parent to kill it off rather than let
# it crash and potentially bring the process down.</Information><Targets>Windows XP SP3</Targets></Module>
