# By setting UserID in the cookie to a long string, we can overwrite EDX which 
# allows us to control execution flow when "call dword ptr [edx+28h]" is 
# executed. EDX is overwritten with an address pointing to a location on the 
# stack which in turn points to a NOP sled leading to the shellcode. This 
# address on the stack is brute forced, but doesn't take long since only the 
# 2nd byte is always different, so the address is always 0x01??B494.  </Information><Targets>Windows XP Professional SP2 and SP3</Targets></Module>
