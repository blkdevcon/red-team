# Desc: Omeka suffers from an authenticated arbitrary PHP code execution.
# The vulnerability is caused due to the improper verification of
# uploaded files in '/admin/items/add' script thru the 'file[0]' POST
# parameter. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by
# uploading a malicious PHP script file that will be stored in
# '/files/original' directory after successfully disabling the file
# validation option (or adding something like 'application/x-php' into the
# allowed MIME types list) and bypassing the rewrite rule in the '.htaccess'
# file with '.php5' extension.</Information><Targets>Kali</Targets></Module>
