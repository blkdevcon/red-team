A tool which helps you embedding a UAC-Bypassing function into your custom Win32 payloads ( x86_64 architecture specifically )
- Tested on Windows 7,8,10 ( 64bit)
- Free and Open-sourced with full source codes published
- If it's not working anymore, please notify me
+ Tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12efahUc-nU ( or for more information, read README.md )

### Requirements:
---
||Linux|Windows|
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Architecture|Optional|x86_64|x86_64|
|Python 3.x >| YES|`NO`|`NO`|
|Module|termcolor|`NO`|
|Distros|Any|Windows|
|Version|Any|Windows 7,8,10|Windows 7,8,10|

### Usage:
---
[ Linux ]:
> This tool does require a python module called `termcolor`. When you run the script it will automatically install it if you haven't, but if you want the tool to function faster, i would suggest you doing it manually before proceeding
```sh
$ pip3 install termcolor #installing termcolor
```
```sh
$ #Temporary usage only, installation below
$ git clone https://github.com/Zenix-Blurryface/SneakyEXE.git
$ cd SneakyEXE/Linux
$ chmod +x sneakyexe.py
$ ./sneakyexe <option>=<path to payload/code> out=<where you wanna save>
```
[ Windows ]:
* visit https://github.com/Zenix-Blurryface/SneakyEXE
* Download the repository, "clone or download" -> "Download ZIP"
* Unzip it into your optional directory
* Change dir to <Directory>\SneakyEXE\Win32\
* Execute sneakyexe.exe ( or sys\sneakyexe.exe for an improved startup speed )
* ( Optional : you can copy sneakyexe.exe to whatever directory you want and delete the unzipped one )
```diff
- NOTE -
The payload can only be successfully executed by the user with Administrator privilege. Users with limited token wouldn't succeed.
```

### Installation:
---
[ Linux ]:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Zenix-Blurryface/SneakyEXE.git
$ cd SneakyEXE
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ sudo ./install.sh
```
[ Windows ]:
* `UNAVAILABLE`
* ( Soon will if many people demand )
### Build:
---
- Built on Opensuse Leap 15.0
- Developed using `Python 3.6.5`
- Developed with `gcc (MinGW.org GCC-8.2.0-3) 8.2.0` for the payload compilation
###### [ Payload Embedding ]
- In order to build the elevator from source, you will need `gcc gcc 8.2.0` ( `c11` ) and a AMD64 machine with Windows 10(7/8) 64-bit installed.
```sh
# Windows 10/7/8 (AMD64)
# Open cmd.exe / powershell.exe
>> gcc -mwindows -o <output>.exe /source/main.c
```
###### [ GUI Version ]
- In order to build the GUI version from source, you will need `Python 3.5.6` ( or higher ) with modules like `Pyinstaller`, `Pillow` and a AMD64 machine with Windows 7 64-bit installed.
```sh
# Assume we already had  Python preinstalled
# Open cmd.exe / powershell.exe
>> pip install pillow      # Installing Pillow
>> pip install pyinstaller # Installing Pyinstaller
>> mkdir compile           # Optional directory name
>> cd compile
>> pyinstaller --windowed --onefile --icon=Icon.ico /source/Win32/GUI.py # For sysematic version ( /sys ), remove --onefile
>> cd dist
>> GUI.exe                 # The compiled executable :}
```
