# Contributing

This document provides some guidelines on how you can contribute to the project.

### General

In every case, be friendly and respect all contributors and users.

### Issues

Have you encountered a problem using Vailyn, or have an amazing idea on how to improve the project? Then, you can report to me by writing an issue!

If possible, use the issue templates provided in the Github folder. This ensures that I obtain all important information, and can act quickly (in case of a bugfix), or have an accurate idea of what you desire to be added to Vailyn.

In case your issue does not fit a template category, you can post it without template, and propose a new template to be added.

### Pull Requests

Are you a developer interested in implementing ideas and fixes? Here are some propositions you can consider when creating a pull request.

* If your code contains instructions that are more challenging to read, please provide a short explanation on what they are doing in a comment. This ensures that everyone will be able to understand the code.
* For each non-trivial function, please summarize in a comment above it what it is for. If it takes arguments or returns objects, consider including what they represent in said comment.
* If you include code from another project, make sure you have permission from the original authors, and that it is compatible with the GPLv3 license. Clearly state where this code is from.
* When submitting the pull request, please include the following information:
  * Does the PR fix a problem in the tool? If yes, describe it. (either referring to an existing issue, or by describing it manually)
  * In case of a feature request, describe in what way(s) the PR improves the tool, and in what situations this can be useful.
  * Does your version need additional dependencies? If so, list them here.
  * On what Python version / OS did you test your changes?
