# This is a super strange exploit. First I would like to commend "FullMetalFouad" #
# for the unicode work on the original exploit. Originally I wanted to see if I   #
# could simplify the process. While I was doing that I lost sight of the fact     #
# that the instructions had to be printable since we need to copy them from a     #
# text file. When I opened my POC I saw that all the characters had been          #
# converted to weird blocks (check my site for a screenshot).</Information><Targets>WinXP PRO SP3</Targets></Module>
