# I tried an alpha3 encoded egghunter but could not fit it in a single buffer and unfortunately it did not work, it wrote an invalid address on the stack then tried to access it
# If you can make it work or find a solution for ASLR/DEP please contact me
# 
# So I wrote from scratch a venetian shellcode that will write the egghunter onto the stack then executes it
# The egg and shellcode can be found in plain ASCII in memory</Information><Targets>Windows XP Professional SP3 Version 2002</Targets></Module>
