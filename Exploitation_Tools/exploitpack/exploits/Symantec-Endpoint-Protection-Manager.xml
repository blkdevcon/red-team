Symantec has an http request handler called ConfigServerHandler that is programmatically 
restricted to only handle requests that come from localhost. I guess when they wrote this 
they just assumed that there was never going to be a way to send untrusted input to it 
since it was always going to be controlled by them. I base this guess on the fact that 
there is absolutely no attempt made to validate what input comes in to the 
updateReportingVersion function which shoves it directly into a SQL query unfiltered.</Information><Targets>11.0, 12.0, 12.1</Targets></Module>
