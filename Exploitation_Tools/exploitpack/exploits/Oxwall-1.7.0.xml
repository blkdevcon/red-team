# Oxwall suffers from an authenticated arbitrary PHP code
# execution. The vulnerability is caused due to the improper
# verification of uploaded files in '/admin/settings/user' script
# thru the 'avatar' and 'bigAvatar' POST parameters. This can be
# exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a malicious
# PHP script file with '.php5' extension (to bypass the '.htaccess'
# block rule) that will be stored in '/ow_userfiles/plugins/base/avatars/'
# directory.</Information><Targets>Kali Linux 3.7</Targets></Module>
