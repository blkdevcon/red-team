# The process memory region starts with a null byte but exploitation is still possible because of 
# the little endian architecture provided that the return address gets placed at the end of the buffer,
# this however confines us in the tiny 4-byte area after pop/pop/retn
# Using a couple of trampolines I jumped back to the beginning of the buffer which is 533 bytes, enough to fit a calc payload</Information><Targets>Windows 7 Ultimate 64 and 32 bit</Targets></Module>
