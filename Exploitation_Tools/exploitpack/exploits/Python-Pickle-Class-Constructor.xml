Python is an open source, object oriented programming language. The Python Pickle module is provided to convert object variables into a serialized form ("pickling"), and later recover the data back into an object hierarchy ("unpickling").
A vulnerability has been reported in the Pickle implementation included with some versions of Python. If specially crafted malicious object data is "unpickled", it may cause arbitrary Python commands to be executed, including system calls. This is accomplished by specifying an available function as the class constructor.
