# Shellerator
Shellerator is a simple command-line tool aimed to help pentesters quickly generate one-liner reverse/bind shells in multiple languages (Bash, Powershell, Java, Python...).
Another similar project for the generation of one-line file downloading commands is based on this code [Uberfile](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/uberfile)

This project is installed by default in the pentesting OS [Exegol](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/Exegol)

![Example (with menus)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShutdownRepo/shellerator/master/assets/example-menus.gif)

# Install
The install is pretty simple, just clone this git and install the requirements.
```
git clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/shellerator
cd shellerator
python3 setup.py install --user
```

# Usage
Usage is dead simple too.
```
usage: shellerator.py [-h] [-b | -r] [-t TYPE] [-p LPORT] [-i LHOST]

Generate a bind/reverse shell

optional arguments:
  -h, --help              show this help message and exit
  -l, --list            Print all the types of shells shellerator can generate
  -b, --bind-shell        Generate a bind shell (you connect to the target)
  -r, --reverse-shell     Generate a reverse shell (the target connects to you)(Default)

Bind shell options:
  -t TYPE, --type TYPE    Type of the shell to generate (Bash, Powershell, Java...)
  -p LPORT, --port LPORT  Listener Port

Reverse shell options:
  -t TYPE, --type TYPE    Type of the shell to generate (Bash, Powershell, Java...)
  -i LHOST, --ip LHOST    Listener IP address
  -p LPORT, --port LPORT  Listener Port
```
If required options are not set, the tool will start in TUI (Terminal User Interface) with pretty menus but CLI works like a charm too.

# To-Do List
## Things to add
Here are some things to add that I have in mind, I'll work on that asap
- Add bindshells
- Add encrypted shells and separate them from bind/rev ?
- Add webshells
- Add some kind of option to help user get info on how to improve shell/tty (rlwrap, stty, ConPty (cf. PayloadsAllTheThings))
