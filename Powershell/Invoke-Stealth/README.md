Techniques:
       · Chimera: Substitute strings and concatenate variables
       · Xencrypt: Compresses and encrypts with random iterations
       · PyFuscation: Obfuscate functions, variables and parameters
       · PSObfuscation: Convert content to bytes and encode with Gzip

Warning: The output script will exponentially multiply the original size
         Chimera & PyFuscation need dependencies to work properly in Windows
