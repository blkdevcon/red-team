# Twitter-eye

## Twitter Information Gathering Tool

Twitter Eye is a Twitter Information Gathering Tool
With Twitter Eye, you can search with various keywords and usernames on Twitter. Then the data you get is saved in a .csv file. This is to make it easy to read. You can then open these files in Excel, LibreOffice or etc.
Twitter Eye is WITHOUT an API Key that you need with most tools for Twitter. 

"Let's make everything easy".. 

Since I'm currently working on a project and I've created this script for it, I thought it would be a good idea to make it public for everyone to benefit from.

Hi there, Shall we play a game..? ðŸ˜ƒ

Have some fun..!
