A message from the author

Dear friend,

Thank you for adding Shellter Pro in your arsenal of pentesting tools.

If you have paid for a copy of Shellter Pro, please don't share it with
other people. The price has been set low enough so that everyone can afford it.

By sharing this tool with others for free, you are certainly not helping anyone,
you are just damaging a project that you and/or someone else has already paid for.

If this tool was kindly passed to you by a friend, please consider buying your own
copy for all the reasons explained above.

Play fair, and you won't be disappointed.

Best Regards,
Kyriakos Economou (@kyREcon)
